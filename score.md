## Relevant Rules, for reference only:
##### Rule 201
... All players begin with zero points.

##### Rule 202
... In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

##### Rule 204
If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

##### Rule 206
When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

##### Rule 208
...In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.
